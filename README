Phenomenon
------------


Phenomenon is a OpenGL graphics/game engine project by Nathan Braswell

It is a learning project that seeks to create a working graphics engine from scratch. (almost)
It currently uses SDL to handle platform specifics.

It implements some of the NeHe OpenGL tutorials, specifically the ports to linux/SDL.
The lazyfoo SDL/OpenGL tutorial is also used sparingly as a reference.
However, no code is copy-pasted. It is all re-writen using C++, multiple files, and a node graph system.

The code is heavily commented, taking its cue from the NeHe tutorials off of which it is based.

Please note that this is a learning project, and I am a student. I'm learning as I go along, and the code will probably be buggy and inefficient. I take no responsibility for any negative consequences stemming from the use of this code or program.

The code may be used under the Zlib or the MIT license.

General Instructions
-------------
main.cpp has a little demo which shows the current capibilites of the engine and is a good starting point.

All that is necessary to use the engine is to include the phenomenon.h file.
The provide main.cpp and Code::Blocks project files should be enough to get started. Currently, the only dependency
the Phenomenon engine has is on SDL, so if you can get SDL working everything should be fine.

Special Windows Instructions
-------------

Compiling the demo on Windows is just a tad more complicated than it is on Linux. Make sure that the Code::Blocks
project file has the correct location of your SDL installation. You also need to copy SDL.dll
into the program directory.
