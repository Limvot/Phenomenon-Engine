Phenomenon is a OpenGL graphics/game engine project by Nathan Braswell

It is a learning project that seeks to create a working graphics engine from scratch. (almost)
It currently uses SDL to handle platform specifics.

It implements many of the NeHe OpenGL tutorials, specificly the ports to linux/SDL.
The lazyfoo SDL/OpenGL tutorial is also used as a reference.
However, no code is copy-pasted. It is all re-writen.

The code is heavliy commented, taking its cue from the NeHe tutorials off of which it is based.

Please note that this is a learning project, and I am a student. I'm learning as I go along, and the code will probally be buggy and inefficent. I take no responsiblity for any negitive consequences stemming from the use of this code or program.

The code may be used under the Zlib or the MIT license.
