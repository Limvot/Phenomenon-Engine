Phenomenon
------------


Phenomenon is a OpenGL graphics/game engine project by Nathan Braswell

It is a learning project that seeks to create a working graphics engine from scratch. (almost)
It currently uses SDL to handle platform specifics and GLEW for OpenGL extension loading.

It was made using many tutorials and references, including http://ogldev.atspace.co.uk/index.html, www.opengl-tutorial.org, http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming, http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Main_Page, as well as Wikipedia, NeHe, and Swiftless.
However, no code is copy-pasted. It is all re-writen using C++, multiple files, and a node graph system.

The code should be well-commented, parts to an almost tutorial extent. Others are less commented just because I haven't gotten around to it.

Please note that this is a learning project, and I am a student. I'm learning as I go along, and the code will probably be buggy and inefficient. I take no responsibility for any negative consequences stemming from the use of this code or program.

The code may be used under the Zlib or the MIT license.

General Instructions
-------------
main.cpp has a little demo which shows the current capibilites of the engine and is a good starting point.

All that is necessary to use the engine is to include the phenomenon.h file.
The provided main.cpp and Code::Blocks project files should be enough to get started. Currently, the only dependencies
the Phenomenon engine has is on SDL and GLEW, so if you can get them working everything should be fine.

Special Windows Instructions
-------------

Compiling the demo on Windows is just a tad more complicated than it is on Linux. Make sure that the Code::Blocks
project file has the correct location of your SDL installation. You also need to copy SDL.dll
into the program directory. GLEW needs to be included as well.
